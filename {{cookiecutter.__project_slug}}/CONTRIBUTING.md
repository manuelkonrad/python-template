# Contributions

Feel free to open an issue to submit a bug report or feature request, or to discuss a potential contribution.

# Code of Conduct

Please follow the [Python Software Foundation Code of Conduct](https://policies.python.org/python.org/code-of-conduct).

# Developer Certificate of Origin

Contributors must certify that their contributions adhere to the requirements of the [Developer Certificate of Origin Version 1.1 (DCO)](https://developercertificate.org) by adding a `Signed-off-by` line to their commit messages using their real name, for example:

```
some commit message

Signed-off-by: Contributor Name <contributor.name@example.com>
```

Furthermore, the commits are required to be GPG-signed. Both, signing-off and GPG-signing, can be achieved by adding the `-s` and `-S` flags to the commit command (assuming the real name has been added to the git config and a GPG key has been set up):

```
git commit -s -S -m "some commit message"
```
